# HANDWRITTEN-CLASSIFICATION-PROJECT
🔢 Handwritten Digit Classification using MNIST
This project builds a machine learning model that accurately classifies handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset using deep learning techniques.

🧠 Objective
To classify grayscale images of handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.

📁 Dataset
